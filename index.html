    <h2>Trick or treating activity guidlines</h2>
    <p> When doing trick or treat, try to avoid direct contact with trick or treaters. Always stay 6 feet away from others who don’t live with you. You should give out treats outdoors,  having individual bags of treats for each kid. Also, wash your hand before giving out treats. Before eating any treat, you should wash your hand with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. </p>
        
    <h2>Mask wear</h2>
    <p>Do not use costume masks to replace cloth masks. Unless it’s made of two or more layers of breathable fabric that cover your mouth and nose. Ensure the mask doesn’t leave gaps around your face.
    Do not wear a costume mask over a cloth mask, it can be dangerous because it can make breathing difficult.  Instead, consider using a Halloween theme cloth mask. 
    </p>
        
    <h2>Lower risk activities</h2>
    <p>There are lower risk activities such as carving and decorating pumpkins with your family. You could create a scavenger hunt trick or treat search for kids around your house. You could also have  a Halloween movie night, or do a virtual Halloween costume contest.
    </p> 
    
    <h2>Gathering Guidelines</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Indoor gathering  poses more risk than outdoor gathering. Indoor gatherings with low ventilation pose more risk than indoor ones with good ventilation such as open windows or doors.</li>
        <li>Long duration gathering poses more risk than short duration gathering.</li>
        <li>Community with higher levels of COVID-19 cases will increase the risk during a gathering. </li>
        <li>The size of the event or gathering should be based on state, local, territorial or tribal safety laws and regulation. </li>
        <li> Gathering with attendees who are traveling from different places poses more threat of COVID than gathering with people who live in the same area. </li>
    </ul>
